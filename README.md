<H1>HEY! This is a tiny step in using your Play.h library.</H1>
I have no Windows PC so I rented a cloud-based PC...

I had not too much time ðŸ˜¢ but I did my best today.

This ia a memo game (like Simon) but it doesn't show you the sequence - **YOU SHOULD GUESS IT!**.

If you guess **right** - the score will **increase**.
If you **miss** - you'll **lose everything**.

By pressing **space** button you'll have a **mega-super-puper** bonus!
